What: I wrote this piece of code so I could connect paired bluetooth devices from terminal (Ubuntu 20.04).  
Why: my computer was so f* slow and would take more than I could wait to open the settings menu. This piece of code let me connect my headphones in the speed of my typing, that's it...  
Edit1: this is useless since I have built a new computer
